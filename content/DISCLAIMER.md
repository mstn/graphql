This repository is an open notebook, that is, an ongoing effort to keep tracks of ideas, results, and - above all - personal mistakes and misunderstandings about a particular topic of my interest.

The intended audience of this notebook is mainly myself. For this reason its content may be rough, incomplete and even wrong. Please bear in mind that and take everything I write with a grain of salt.
