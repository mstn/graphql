This repository is an [open notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science), that is, an ongoing effort to keep tracks of ideas, results, and - above all - personal mistakes and misunderstandings about a particular topic of my interest without any filter or delay and in the most transparent way.

The intended audience of this notebook is mainly myself and I write this material only in my spare time for fun and curiosity. For this reason its content may be _rough, incomplete and even wrong_. Please bear in mind that and take everything I write with a grain of salt. Said that, criticisms, suggestions and contributions are welcome.

New material will be published on an irregular basis. Content can be edited in order to keep it tidy and well-organized. Nevertheless it will possible to track back previous versions from git log and commit messages.
