# Changelog

### Next

* I am focussing on the definition of an abstract syntax for GraphQL. I rewrote the initial proposal I wrote almost a year ago following an approach closer to {{ "pierce02" | cite}} with a _small step_ semantics style.
* Syntax and semantics are not definitive and, currently, there are some design flaws in my own definitions. I am testing different options while, at the same time, I am trying to reverse engineer the semantics of the real GraphQL [here](https://github.com/mstn/graphql-playground).
* My goal is to reach a version where safety property holds.
* I am working on a subset of the language without fragments and unions.
