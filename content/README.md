# Introduction

This project is an attempt to study GraphQL in the hard way, that is, building some abstract theoretical tools for reasoning about GraphQL and related architectures.

We want to share our struggles since the first commit in order to get early feedback and to verify if somebody is interested in contributing following this approach. _Please bear in mind that this is a very preliminary still unrevised work._

We will try to keep it simple and informal. Nevertheless, some preliminary background is required. A good reference full of examples and solved exercises is {{ "pierce02" | cite}}. You can also find various lesson notes on the web for free about formal semantics of programming languages.

The rest of this project is organized as follows.

## Part I - Abstract GraphQL

As far I know, Facebook did not provide a formal specification of the language, execution semantics and type system. There is only a reference implementation {{ "graphql-ref-impl" | cite }} in Javascript and an informal spec document {{ "graphql-spec" | cite }}. In this section, we want to fill this gap.

## Part II - Extensions

(coming soon)

## Part III - Comparisons

(coming soon)
