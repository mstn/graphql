# GraphQL Notes

This is a personal notebook where I writes about [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html) and related topics.

Feel free to read it if you find it useful, but please keep in mind the [DISCLAIMER](content/DISCLAIMER.md).
This is not another tutorial about GraphQL, but my own unconventional way to try to learn it.
