# GraphQL Notes

This is a personal notebook where I writes about [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html) and related topics.
This is not another tutorial about GraphQL, but my own unconventional way to try to learn it.

## GraphQL semantics

As far I know, GraphQL does not provide a formal semantics of the language. Hence, I am trying to fill the gap with the definition of an abstract syntax and semantics.

The abstract syntax is not syntactically one-to-one with the language generated by the GraphQL grammar. For example, I introduced more constructs (e.g. holes, contexts, ...) than those described by the official spec. Ideally, the abstract syntax should be a tool for reasoning about the real or target language and not the language itself.

The general approach I am following for the formalization of GraphQL semantics can be summarized in these assumptions.

* Queries are terms with a type.
* Schemas are types.
* The execution of a query yields a value following an operational semantics.
* Execution does not get stuck if the schema type is a subtype of the query type.

My main reference is [Pierce2002], that is also recommended as background material. Other references can be found in the text.

### Current status

* Sketched safety proof.
* Fragments and disjoint unions.
* Definition of an abstract syntax for GraphQL with a _small step_ semantics style following {{ "pierce02" | cite}}.
* Tests for reverse engineering the semantics of the real GraphQL [here](https://github.com/mstn/graphql-playground).
*  Syntax and semantics are not definitive and, currently, there are some flaws in my own definitions.

See [Changelog](content/CHANGELOG.md) to stay updated.
